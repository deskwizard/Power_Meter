Dump of the meter's EEPROM

Considering the way it was dumped, it might not be accurate.

The meter was used overnight before dumping, so I don't know if the 
sparse data that's in there is calibration information or something else.
I did not set a kwh price value, so that's probably not related to that.

How it was dumped:
Since I don't have an EEPROM reader/programmer, I had to resort to other measures.
I used that, running on an ESP32 since it's the only 3.3v board I had available.

Note: 
If you get the following error when compiling: "undefined reference to 'print_eeprom'
Edit the 'eeprom.h' file, removing 'inline' from line 38.

The command used is as follows (see github project page for more details):
i2c_read_eeprom -t /dev/ttyUSB0 -n 2048 -o EEPROM_dump.bin -d 1

That command was the only one that gave me consistent results.

I did disconnect the iÂ²c lines from the display board before dumping so that the
two masters don't fight each other.

The EEPROM address (all address pins grounded) is 0x50.

The pullups (10k) are on the measuring board.
