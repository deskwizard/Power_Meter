The EEPROM_dump.bin file is a dump of the EEPROM content.
I haven't set any values for kW/h, so that location (if any) is undertermined at the moment.

The run time is NOT stored into EEPROM, value is reset if battery power is lost.

The EEPROM contains "calibration" values for Voltage, Current and Power.
See the EEPROM.txt file for the addresses and what they relate to.

I did disconnect the iÂ²c lines from the display board before dumping so that the
two masters don't fight each other.

The EEPROM address (all address pins grounded) is 0x50.

The pullups (10k) are on the measuring board.


How it was dumped:
Since I don't have an EEPROM reader/programmer, I had to resort to other measures.
I used the following, running on an ESP32 since it's the only 3.3V board I had available.

Note: 
If you get the following error when compiling: "undefined reference to 'print_eeprom'
Edit the 'eeprom.h' file, removing the word 'inline' from line 38.

The command used is as follows (see github project page for more details):
i2c_read_eeprom -t /dev/ttyUSB0 -n 256 -o EEPROM_dump.bin -d 1
