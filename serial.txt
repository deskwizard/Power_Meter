Format: 
CMD, ADRR, DATA_L, DATA_M, DATA_H, SUM


Sum calculation (from datasheet):
SUM = (Addr+Data_L+Data_M+Data_H) & 0xFF, then byte invert

Commands:
CA = Write
35 = Read


Numbers between brackets are the bit number(s).
All others are in hex.


On mains power enable:

First does these writes:

CA 3E 55 00 00 6C       Write WRPROT register with 0x55
                        Write protection register, 0x55 = writable


CA 14 00 00 10 DB       Write MODE register with 0x10
Page 11: 
[1:0] = 00      Set metering channel to A
[4:2] = 000     Enable all high-pass filters
[9:8] = 01      Positive-only energy accumulation
[11:10] = 00    Current imbalance judgment 12.5% (default)

Page 7:
[6] = 0         Disable timing anti-creep function
Other bits in the MODE register are not mentionned in datasheet.


CA 15 04 00 00 E6       Write GAIN register with 0x04
Page 6:
Gain for channel A current set to 16x
Rest at default (0)


CA 19 08 00 00 DE       Write WA_CFDIV register with 0x08 (Active power CF frequency divider)
Page 9: 
CF output frequency only used for calibration, not actually connected in circuit.


CA 3E AA 00 00 17       Write WRPROT register with 0xAA 
                        Write protection register, 0xAA = not writable?



Then repeats those reads over and over:

35 05       Read IA_RMS register
35 07       Read V_RMS register
35 09       Read FREQ register
35 A0       Read A_WATT (Average active power of Channel A)
35 08       Read PF register (Power Factor)
35 0C       Read WATTHR (Active Energy)
